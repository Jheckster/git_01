## First Verse

And full DOLORUM OMNIUM,  
Excepting when YOU choose to come  
And share my dinner?  
At other times be sour and glum

“Anniversary Letter”  
You give me excuse after excuse,  
With your eyes giving loving looks, your snarky comments, your comforting breaths -  
If I struggle to breathe,   
Every rocky day when we get to be together and present to hold each other afterwards.  
Every time  
I doubt myself you stay my rock.  
I will be here for you.  
I want to work for what we have, and I want us  
To always prosper,  
That is something I can wish for. But you took those wishes,  
And made them a reality.  
I am safe with you, and I am loved by you continuously.
